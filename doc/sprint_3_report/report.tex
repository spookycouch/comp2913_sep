		\begin{table}[H]
			\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
				\hline
				\textbf{No} & \textbf{Name}                                                        & \textbf{Status} \\ \hline
				3           & Pay for monthly or annual membership                                 & UF              \\ \hline
				4           & Book and pay for an activity at a specified date and time            & P               \\ \hline
				9           & Option to book regular sessions (weekly) at a discounted rate        & UF              \\ \hline
				10          & Handle card payment for booking (simulated)                          & P               \\ \hline
				15          & Barcode or QR code on receipt, for validation                        & P              \\ \hline
				17          & store user’s payment card details for quicker checkout               & P               \\ \hline
				18          & good security for user accounts and data                             & P               \\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}
		
		\section{Team Participation}
		\hspace*{1em}Most team members are actively participating where possible, given the current global climate. Unfortunately we have not been able to get Sizwe to participate in the project past the initial brainstorming phase, despite our best efforts to make him feel welcome.
		\\
		\\
		\hspace*{1em}We would appreciate if the module leaders could take this into account, as we had all agreed to create an accompanying mobile application to the web app, which required all 6 of us being involved over the duration of the project.\\
		
		\section{Plan for finalisation}
		\hspace*{1em}The final 7 features of the web application are set to be complete by 12 April, leaving 2 weeks over the Easter break to polish the web app and complete the final report and mobile application.
		\\
		\\
		\hspace*{1em}The team will stick to its current configuration of 2 members on the web front-end, 2 on back-end, and 1 on mobile app development.\\
		
		\section{Meetings}
		\hspace*{1em}Meetings are still taking place on a weekly basis over Discord, and minutes and attendance are up-to-date on the GitLab wiki. Informal meetings for bug-fixing and clarifying doubts are also occurring regularly in addition to the scheduled ones listed on the wiki.
