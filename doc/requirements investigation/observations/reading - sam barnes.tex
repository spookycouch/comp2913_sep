\section{Observations}

A good article to read is:

\begin{center}	
	https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/9-essential-sport-web-design-features/
\end{center}

Explains the relationship between colours and the mood they convey, the use of angles and polygons as seen in lots of the above examples; The Gym, Leisure Centre for example. Explains the use of proper positional items, including overlapping and simple fonts and the need for powerful imagery 

\subsection{Takeaway}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use light colours, such as whites, blues and greens
	
	\item Make use of powerful imagery, such as on landing jumbotron, sports selection etc.
	
	\item Always show pricing and memberships on the landing page
	
	\item Include sections on wellbeing
	
	\item For admin, allow them to add new sports, view booking / reservations, change prices, add membership options, view members etc.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Questions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Who is the website meant for? will it include a centre locator like the gym or city council websites, or is it for a singular centre?
	
	\item Where will we get and licence the images from; all the websites make use of images, where will we get ours? If we use a free image site such as pexels how will we ensure images are relevant? If we licence images from existing centres how will we get permission?
	
	\item Will we have a database for different sports and activities, such that these can be extended, or will this be hard-coded? If the latter, how will reservations, memberships and booking interact with these entities?
	
	\item how will the interface for employees be considered; will this be integrated within the web application, or separate such as a desktop application?
	
	
	
	
\end{itemize}
